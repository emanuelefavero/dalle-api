# DALLe API

This repo quickly shows how to use the OpenAI API (pay service) to generate images from a prompt (same as [DALLe](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/))

## Installation

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

- Change the **prompt** text in `generate.js`

```bash
node generate.js
```

NOTE: You need to have a valid API key to use this. You can get one [here](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/)
